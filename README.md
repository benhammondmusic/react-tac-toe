## Background

Decided to practice my React skills by recreating the classic game; ended up with a goofy yet compelling little app.

## Details

- Used functional components and hooks like `useEffect()` and `useState()`.
- Fixed up the win- and tie-condition timing issues I'd been having.
- Deployed to Netlify, straightforward using their GitHub integration for CI/CD.

## Style

For a bit of whimsy I ultimately decided to style the entire board like the default `create-react-app` logo, so that the game actually spins in glowing aqua-blue as you play. Not only did I think it was funny and kinda cool; in all honesty it brings a level of drama to tic-tac-toe gameplay that I haven't experienced in since I was 7 years old.
